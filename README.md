# Python_charmers
This repository contains notebooks to teach Python programming. They were created to accompany my lectures for the Introduction to Programming course at University of Delhi. 
They are beginner friendly (hopefully) and based on Python3. So start practicing for a quick hands-on introduction to Python.
